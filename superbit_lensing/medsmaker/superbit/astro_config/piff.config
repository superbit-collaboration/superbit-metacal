# This sample config file is based on the config file that was used for the
# Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 analysis and included in the DES Y3 paper,
# Jarvis, et al, 2020 (Appendix B).

# The main change from that configuration file is that this one uses the
# SingleChip psf type, which produces a single output file for a whole exposure,
# rather than a separate one for each CCD.

# However, there is only a single CCD image included in the repo, so as given,
# the output file will only have the solution for a single CCD.  If desired,
# you may get the full list of exposures and input catalogs via
#
#   wget https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~mjarvis/desy3.tar.gz --no-check-certificate
#   tar xfz desy3.tar.gz
#
# After unpacking the tarball, the 350139 directory will have all the exposures,
# not just chip 12.
#
# Also, this configuration requilres the pixmappy Python package, which can be
# installed via
#
#   pip install git+https://github.com/gbernstein/pixmappy.git
#
# However, if you don't want to use that, you can remove (or comment out) the
# modules and input.wcs fields, in which case, the code will use the (less
# accurate) WCS that ships with the image in the fits file.
