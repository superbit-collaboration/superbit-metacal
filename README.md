# superbit-metacal
Contains a collection of routines used to perform ngmix fits, including metacalibration, on simulated SuperBIT images.

This repo has recently been significantly refactored into the new `superbit_lensing` module, which you can include in your desired environment by running `python setup.py install` without the need to add the various submodules to your `PYTHONPATH`. The module includes the following four submodules which can be used independently if desired:

  - `galsim`: Contains scripts that generate the simulated SuperBIT observations used for validation and forecasting analyses.
  - `medsmaker`: Contains small modifications to the original superbit-ngmix scripts that make coadd images, runs SExtractor & PSFEx, and creates MEDS files.
  - `metacalibration`: Contains scripts used to run the ngmix/metacalibration algorithms on the MEDS files produced by Medsmaker. 
  - `shear-profiles`: Contains scripts to compute the tangential/cross shear profiles and output to a file, as well as plots of the shear profiles.

More detailed descriptions for each stage are contained in their respective directories.

To run the full pipeine in sequence (or a particular subset), we have created the `SuperBITPipeline` class in `superbit_lensing/pipe.py` along with a subclass for each of the submodules. This is run by passing a single yaml configuration file that defines the run options for the pipeline run. The most important arguments are as follows:

- `run_name`: The name of the run, which is also used to specify the `outdir` if you do not provide one; **Required**
- `order`: A list of submodule names that you want the pipeline to run in the given order; **Required**
- `vb`: Verbose. Only affects terminal output; everything is saved to a pipeline log file as well as a log for each submodule; **Required**
- `ncores`: The number of CPU cores to use. Will default to half of the available cores if not provided. Can overwrite for specific submodules in their respective configs if desired; _Optional_
- `run_diagnostics`: A bool. Set to `True` run the diagnostics, including plots which are saved in `{outdir}/plots/`; _Optional_

These should be set in the `run_options` field of the config file, while options for each submodule should be set in a field with the same name (e.g. `medsmaker: {...}`). Once the configuration is set, run the pipeline by doing the following:
```
import superbit_lensing.utils as utils
from superbit_lensing.pipe import SuperBITPipeline

log = utils.setup_logger({logfile}, logdir={logdir})
pipe = SuperBITPipeline(config_file, log)

rc = pipe.run()

assert(rc == 0)
```
An example of a pipeline run along with a test configuration is given in `pipe.main()`, which can be run with `python pipe.py`. A more general configuration file is shown in `configs/pipe_test_real_sims.yaml` An example wrapper script you can use to run the `SuperBITPipeline` is shown in `superbit-lensing/process_all.py`.

The available config options for each submodule are defined in the various module classes in `superbit_lensing.pipe.py`, such as `GalSimModule`. The required & optional fields are given in `_req_fields` and `_opt_fields` respectively. The pipeline runner tells you if you fail to pass a required field or if you pass something that it doesn't understand.

## For the experts

If you want to add a new submodule to the pipeline, simply define a new subclass `MyCustomModule(SuperBITModule)` that implements the abstract `run()` function of the parent class and add it to `pipe.MODULE_TYPES` to register it with the rest of the pipeline. You should also implement the desired required & optional parameters that can be present in the module config with the class variables `_req_fields` and `_opt_fields`, which should be lists.
